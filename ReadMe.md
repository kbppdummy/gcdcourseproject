# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains all the scripts and data for the course project of the Coursera course _Getting and Cleaning Data_.

## Directory Details

1. data folder
	Contains the edited data for the R scripts.
	Edits are done on:
		- `features.txt` file
			- removed the excess `)` at line 556
			- added `-X`, `-Y`, or `-Z` to all features using the `bandsEnergy()` function (since they are duplicated thrice, I guess they just forgot to include the coordinate labels)
2. `CodeBook.md`
	The code book for the data generated by the scripts, and information for the scripts.
3. `functions.R`, `merge.R`, `run_analysis.R`
	The R scripts used to generated the new data.
4. `merged.txt`
	Contains the data generated for the first data set--combined train and test data sets containing only the mean and standard deviation values.
5. `summaries.txt`
	Contains the data generated for the second data set--averages of all measurements from the first data set as grouped by their `activity` labels and `subject.id`s.
